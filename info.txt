app.py is a flask app with some basic front end it is not all complete update and insert DO NOT WORK
to get these to work I was thinking of using a simple form to just insert data and then insert/update database 

the audit table is on a trigger so each time the road_netowrk table is UPDATED, DELETED, INSERT the info will be added to the auditlog

HOW TO RUN:

1. in postgres you can use /i PATH TO: exercise.sql to create the database that includes the road_netowrk and audit log

2. in app.py you need to enter the password and database name you are using (default database name is exercise unless changed in exercise.sql) 

3. python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt (pip install all packages)
    - Best to create a virtual environment

4. run main.py
